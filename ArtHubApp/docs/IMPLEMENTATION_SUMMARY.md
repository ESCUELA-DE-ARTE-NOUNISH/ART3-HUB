- **Status**: ‚úÖ Complete with independent contract deployment
- **Features**:
  - Each claimable NFT type gets its own contract
  - Independent access controls per NFT type
  - Factory pattern for efficient deployment
  - Admin CRUD operations for claimable NFTs

## üèóÔ∏è Current V6 Architecture

### Collection-per-NFT Flow:
1. **User creates NFT** ‚Üí New collection contract deployed via Factory V6
2. **Relayer mints** ‚Üí NFT minted to relayer using `GASLESS_RELAYER_PRIVATE_KEY`
3. **Auto-transfer** ‚Üí NFT automatically transferred to user's wallet
4. **Database storage** ‚Üí NFT recorded in Firebase with user-created flag
5. **Marketplace ready** ‚Üí Collection contract available for future marketplace operations

### Smart Contract Deployment:
```bash
# V6 Fresh Deployment with Secure Gasless Relayer as Owner

# Gasless Relayer Configuration
GASLESS_RELAYER_PRIVATE_KEY=your_secure_relayer_key
```

## üöÄ How V6 Works Now

### For User NFT Creation:
1. User uploads image and fills metadata form
2. Frontend calls SimpleNFTService.createNFT()
3. Service calls /api/gasless-relay with 'createNFTWithCollection' type
4. Relayer deploys new collection contract via Factory V6
5. Relayer mints NFT to itself using collection's mint function
6. NFT automatically transferred to user's wallet
7. NFT stored in Firebase with user_created: true flag

### For Subscription Progress Tracking:
1. Subscription component queries /api/nfts/user-created endpoint
2. Only user-created NFTs count toward monthly quota
3. Claimable NFTs shown separately for information only
4. Progress bar reflects accurate user-created NFT usage

### For Claimable NFTs:
1. Admin creates claimable NFT via factory pattern
2. Independent contract deployed for each claimable NFT type
3. Users claim NFTs through gasless system
4. Claimable NFTs stored with user_created: false flag

## üîß V6 Major Improvements

### 1. Simplified Architecture
- ‚ùå **Removed**: Complex voucher-based gasless system
- ‚úÖ **Added**: Direct contract interaction via relayer
- ‚úÖ **Result**: Faster, more reliable NFT creation

### 2. Enhanced Marketplace Compatibility
- ‚ùå **Old**: Shared collection contracts limited marketplace features
- ‚úÖ **New**: Individual collection contracts enable full marketplace functionality
- ‚úÖ **Future**: Users can create copies, set up marketplaces, enable trading

### 3. Accurate Quota Tracking
- ‚ùå **Old**: All NFTs counted toward subscription limits
- ‚úÖ **New**: Only user-created NFTs count toward monthly quotas
- ‚úÖ **Result**: Fair usage tracking that doesn't penalize claimable NFT claims

### 4. Improved Security
- ‚ùå **Old**: Multiple sensitive configuration variables scattered
- ‚úÖ **New**: Single secure relayer configuration variable
- ‚úÖ **Audit**: Complete security audit ensures no sensitive data outside .env

## üìã Testing the V6 Flow

### 1. User NFT Creation:
1. Connect wallet and go to `/create`
2. Upload image and fill metadata
3. Click "Create NFT"
4. Verify NFT appears in user's wallet
5. Check that new collection contract was deployed

### 2. Subscription Progress:
1. Go to `/profile`
2. Verify progress bar shows only user-created NFTs
3. Claim a claimable NFT
4. Verify progress bar doesn't increment for claimable NFT

### 3. Admin Operations:
1. Login as admin wallet
2. Navigate to admin pages without redirects
3. Create claimable NFTs via factory pattern
4. Verify independent contract deployment

## üõ°Ô∏è V6 Security Features

### Security Configuration:
- All sensitive data stored in .env files only
