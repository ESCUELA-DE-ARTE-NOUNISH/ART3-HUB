# Intelligent Chat System

The Art3 Hub Intelligent Chat System is an enhanced AI assistant that guides artists through personalized conversations to determine their optimal learning path. It features user memory, conversation tracking, and intelligent recommendations.

## üéØ Core Features

### 3 Outcome Paths
After 3-5 questions, the agent recommends one of three paths:

1. **Tutorial Path** (`/tutorials/art3hub-connect.mp4`)
   - For beginners needing step-by-step guidance
   - Shows introduction video to Art3 Hub

2. **Opportunities Path** (`/opportunities`)
   - For artists seeking art projects and collaborations
   - Redirects to opportunities page

3. **Create Path** (`/create`)
   - For users ready to create their first NFT
   - Redirects to NFT creation page

### User Memory System
- **Persistent Memory**: Uses wallet address for user identification
- **Learning Progress**: Tracks completed tutorials and preferences
- **Conversation Context**: Remembers past interactions and outcomes
- **Adaptive Responses**: Personalizes conversation based on history

### Intelligent Assessment
- **Progressive Questions**: 5 assessment questions maximum
- **Response Analysis**: Scores user responses to determine experience level
- **Confidence Rating**: Provides confidence score for recommendations
- **Multi-language Support**: Available in English, Spanish, French, Portuguese

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Migration
Run the migration to create necessary tables:
```bash
npm run db:migrate:chat
```

Or manually execute the SQL in Supabase:
```bash
# The migration script will show you the SQL to run
npm run db:migrate:chat
```

### 2. Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in your `.env.local`:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=your_redis_url
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your_redis_token
```

### 3. Access the System
- **New Interface**: `/[locale]/ai-agent/intelligent`
- **Original Interface**: `/[locale]/ai-agent` (still available)

## üì± Usage Flow

### 1. User Connection
- User connects wallet (required for intelligent features)
- System creates or retrieves user memory
- Conversation session begins

### 2. Assessment Phase
The agent asks up to 5 questions about:
- **Experience Level**: Digital art background
- **Goals**: Learning vs. opportunities vs. creating
- **Interests**: Art styles and preferences
- **Time Availability**: Learning commitment
- **Technical Comfort**: Technology familiarity

### 3. Recommendation Phase
Based on assessment responses and user history:
- Analyzes responses with scoring algorithm
- Considers past preferences and outcomes
- Provides recommendation with confidence score
- Shows outcome card with clear next steps

### 4. Action Phase
- User can accept recommendation and redirect
- Or continue conversation for clarification
- System updates memory with outcome choice

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### API Endpoints

#### `/api/chat/intelligent` (POST)
Enhanced chat endpoint with memory and assessment.

**Request Body:**
```json
