  - `/scripts/deploy-with-env.js` - Node.js deployment script
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Ready for deployment
- **Features**:
  - `mintWithClaimCode()` function for tracking claim codes
  - `isClaimCodeUsed()` for validation
  - Owner-only minting for security
  - Token URI support for metadata

### 3. Blockchain Service Integration
- **File**: `/lib/services/blockchain-service.ts`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Updated for real contract calls
- **Features**:
  - `mintClaimableNFT()` method for real minting
  - Proper chain configuration
  - Transaction receipt parsing
  - Error handling for chain switching

### 4. Claim Code Verification
- **File**: `/app/api/claim-code/verify/route.ts`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Working with contract address detection
- **Features**:
  - Case-insensitive claim code validation
  - Contract address fallback logic
  - Wallet connection detection

### 5. User Minting Interface
- **File**: `/app/[locale]/mint/page.tsx`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Complete with real/mock detection
- **Features**:
  - Automatic detection of real vs mock contracts
  - Real blockchain transaction for deployed contracts
  - Mock simulation for testing
  - Proper error handling and user feedback

### 6. Admin Interface Updates
- **Files**: 
  - `/components/admin/CreateNFTForm.tsx`
  - `/components/admin/NFTDetailView.tsx`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Enhanced with contract deployment feedback
- **Features**:
  - Contract deployment status display
  - Manual contract address setting for testing
  - Enhanced admin UI with contract information

## üèóÔ∏è Current Architecture

### Contract Flow:
1. **Admin creates NFT** ‚Üí API checks for deployed ClaimableNFT contract
2. **Contract exists** ‚Üí Uses existing contract address
3. **User claims** ‚Üí Calls `mintWithClaimCode()` on real contract
4. **Transaction recorded** ‚Üí Both on-chain and in Firebase

### Environment Configuration:
```bash
# Testing mode (uses Base Sepolia)
NEXT_PUBLIC_IS_TESTING_MODE=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLAIMABLE_NFT_CONTRACT_84532=0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890

# Production mode (uses Base mainnet)
NEXT_PUBLIC_IS_TESTING_MODE=false
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLAIMABLE_NFT_CONTRACT_8453=<deployed_contract_address>
```

## üöÄ How It Works Now

### For Real Contract Deployment:
1. Deploy ClaimableNFT contract using deployment scripts
2. Update environment variables with contract address
3. Admin creates claimable NFT with status "published"
4. Users claim NFTs using real blockchain transactions

### For Testing:
1. Mock contract address is set in environment
2. System detects mock address and simulates transactions
3. All functionality works without real blockchain calls
4. Perfect for development and testing

## üîß Next Steps for Production

### 1. Deploy Real Contracts
```bash
# Deploy to Base Sepolia (testnet)
npx tsx scripts/deploy-claimable-nft.ts testnet

# Deploy to Base mainnet (production)
npx tsx scripts/deploy-claimable-nft.ts mainnet
```

### 2. Update Environment Variables
Replace mock addresses with real deployed contract addresses:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLAIMABLE_NFT_CONTRACT_84532=<real_testnet_address>
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLAIMABLE_NFT_CONTRACT_8453=<real_mainnet_address>
```

### 3. Security Configuration
```bash
# Replace with secure private key
ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY=<secure_private_key>

# Ensure admin wallet is correctly set
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_WALLET=<admin_wallet_address>
```

## üìã Testing the Complete Flow

### 1. Admin Side:
1. Login as admin (using `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_WALLET`)
2. Go to `/admin/nfts/create`
3. Create NFT with status "published"
4. Verify contract address is assigned

### 2. User Side:
1. Go to `/mint`
2. Enter the claim code created by admin
3. Connect wallet
4. Mint the NFT (real transaction if contract is deployed)

### 3. Verification:
1. Check transaction on block explorer
2. Verify NFT appears in user's wallet
3. Confirm claim code is marked as used in admin interface

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Admin Authorization:
- Only `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_WALLET` can create NFTs
- Server-side validation of admin status
- Private key protection for contract deployment

### Contract Security:
- Owner-only minting in ClaimableNFT contract
- Claim code uniqueness enforcement
- Proper access control on all functions

### Environment Security:
- Private keys in environment variables only
- No sensitive data in client-side code
- Proper separation of test/production configs

## üìà Current Status

**The claimable NFT system is now fully implemented and ready for real blockchain deployment.**

‚úÖ **Working**: Admin creation, user claiming, contract integration
‚úÖ **Tested**: Mock transactions, API endpoints, UI flows  
üîß **Ready**: Contract deployment, environment configuration
üöÄ **Next**: Deploy real contracts and update environment variables

The system seamlessly handles both testing (with mock contracts) and production (with real deployed contracts) based on the environment configuration.
