# ART3-HUB
Mini app built on Base that acts as an educational and transactional bridge for artists entering Web3. It combines a custom AI agent that offers step-by-step guidance—from what a wallet is to how to mint an NFT—with integrated tools that allow users to mint their creations directly, without technical knowledge.
