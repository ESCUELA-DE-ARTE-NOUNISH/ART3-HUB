# Art3Hub V5 Deployment Guide

## Overview

Art3Hub V5 represents a major architectural shift towards **Base-only deployment** with enhanced **on-chain data storage** and **database minimization**. This version eliminates dependencies on traditional databases by storing all critical data directly on the blockchain.

## üéØ V5 Key Features

### üîµ Base-Only Architecture
- **Single Network Focus**: Deployed exclusively on Base (mainnet) and Base Sepolia (testnet)
- **Optimized Performance**: Reduced complexity and improved reliability
- **Cost Efficiency**: Leverage Base's low gas costs for enhanced features

### üìä Enhanced On-Chain Data Storage
- **Creator Profiles**: Complete user profiles stored on-chain (name, username, email, social links, verification status)
- **NFT Extended Metadata**: Categories, tags, IPFS hashes, royalties, visibility settings
- **Social Features**: Likes, ratings, views, and engagement metrics stored on-chain
- **Search & Discovery**: Advanced filtering by category, tags, creator, and social metrics

### üîç Database Minimization
- **Contract-Based Data Reading**: Frontend reads directly from smart contracts
- **Reduced API Dependencies**: Eliminates need for traditional database queries
- **Real-Time Data**: Always current data directly from blockchain
- **Improved Reliability**: No database downtime or synchronization issues

  - Platform-wide discovery and analytics
  - Category and tag management
  - Search functionality across all collections

## üìã Prerequisites

### Required Tools
- Node.js (v18+)
- Hardhat
- Base network access
- USDC for subscription payments

### Environment Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure `.env` file with required variables

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# Private key for deployment (‚ö†Ô∏è Use a dedicated deployment wallet)
PRIVATE_KEY=your_deployment_private_key_here

# API keys for contract verification
BASESCAN_API_KEY=your_basescan_api_key

# Network configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_IS_TESTING_MODE=true  # Set to false for mainnet

# Treasury configuration
TREASURY_WALLET=0x8ea4b5e25c45d34596758dA2d3F27a8096eeFEb9
```

## üöÄ Deployment Process

### Step 1: Compile Contracts
```bash
cd /path/to/ArtHubContract
npm run compile
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Base Sepolia (Testnet)
```bash
npm run deploy:v5:baseSepolia
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Base Mainnet (Production)
```bash
npm run deploy:v5:base
```

### Expected Output
The deployment script will:
1. Deploy Art3HubSubscriptionV4
2. Deploy Art3HubCollectionV5 implementation
3. Deploy Art3HubFactoryV5
4. Verify contract integration
5. Generate deployment summary
6. Output environment variables

## üìù Post-Deployment Configuration

### 1. Update Frontend Environment Variables
Add the deployed contract addresses to your frontend `.env` file:

```bash
# Art3Hub V5 Contract Addresses (Base Sepolia - Chain ID: 84532)
NEXT_PUBLIC_ART3HUB_FACTORY_V5_84532=0x...
NEXT_PUBLIC_ART3HUB_SUBSCRIPTION_V5_84532=0x...
NEXT_PUBLIC_ART3HUB_COLLECTION_V5_IMPL_84532=0x...

# Art3Hub V5 Contract Addresses (Base Mainnet - Chain ID: 8453)
NEXT_PUBLIC_ART3HUB_FACTORY_V5_8453=0x...
NEXT_PUBLIC_ART3HUB_SUBSCRIPTION_V5_8453=0x...
NEXT_PUBLIC_ART3HUB_COLLECTION_V5_IMPL_8453=0x...
```

### 2. Update Art3HubV5Service
The service will automatically detect the deployed addresses based on the environment variables.

### 3. Configure Frontend Components
Update frontend components to use the new V5 service for data reading instead of database APIs.

## üîß Contract Verification

### Automatic Verification
The deployment script includes automatic verification steps. If manual verification is needed:

```bash
# Verify Art3HubSubscriptionV4
npx hardhat verify --network baseSepolia <SUBSCRIPTION_ADDRESS> "<TREASURY_WALLET>" "<USDC_ADDRESS>" "<DEPLOYER_ADDRESS>"

# Verify Art3HubCollectionV5 Implementation
npx hardhat verify --network baseSepolia <COLLECTION_IMPL_ADDRESS>

# Verify Art3HubFactoryV5
npx hardhat verify --network baseSepolia <FACTORY_ADDRESS> "<SUBSCRIPTION_ADDRESS>" "<GASLESS_RELAYER>" "<DEPLOYER_ADDRESS>"
```

## üé® V5 Enhanced Features
